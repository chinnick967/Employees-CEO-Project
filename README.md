# Employees-CEO-Project

Author: Dakota Chinnick

Job application challenge project written in PHP for an employer that is going to be amazed and hire me.

# Getting Started

To get yourself setup you will need to clone this repository onto your local computer. This project requires the Employees database provided by the company 
that gave me this project that has not been included in this repository.

You will want to open up Connect.php and enter in your server and database details.

Run Index.php on your local host to start the application.

# Usage

The application will display each Employee's ID, Name, and Distance from the CEO (edges). It is paginated to show 100 entries at a time.

You can use the arrows at the top to move to the next page of results. If there is no arrow present than that means that there are no more results to show.

You can also use the search box on the right side to search through the Employees using certain characters. You will get a list of Employees that is filtered based off the string you submit.

# Hiring Me

Upon completion of your evaluation of this project you will think "Hmm, this guy is pretty good" and will call me up to let me know that I have the job.

If you are on the fence about hiring me or another applicant then this is likely a bug and should be reported to the developer.
